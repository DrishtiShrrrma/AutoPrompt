Here are the rules: I'll draw a certain number of cards and then arrange them in a certain order in a stack, face down. After I do that, I'll describe a series of steps, and your job will be to keep track of the cards and answer a question about the final ordering.

Okay, from top to bottom, here's the starting layout:

2 of clubs
3 of hearts
King of spades
Queen of hearts
Jack of clubs
Ace of diamonds

Now, here are the steps I'm taking to jumble up the stack.

I take the top three cards and place them at the bottom of the stack.
I take the top card and place it under the second card.
I take the top two cards and place them under the third card.
I take the bottom card and place it on top of the stack.

6af95c8f-8cbf-4c12-b02c-f9a23cc1ecb9,"Here's a fun riddle that I'd like you to try.

An adventurer exploring an ancient tomb came across a horde of gold coins, all neatly stacked in columns. As he reached to scoop them into his backpack, a mysterious voice filled the room. ""You have fallen for my trap adventurer,"" the voice began, and suddenly the doorway to the chamber was sealed by a heavy rolling disk of stone. The adventurer tried to move the stone disk but was unable to budge the heavy stone. Trapped, he was startled when the voice again spoke. 

""If you solve my riddle, I will reward you with a portion of my riches, but if you are not clever, you will never leave this treasure chamber. Before you are 200 gold coins. I pose a challenge to you, adventurer. Within these stacks of coins, all but 30 are face-up. You must divide the coins into two piles, one is yours, and one is mine. You may place as many coins as you like in either pile. You may flip any coins over, but you may not balance any coins on their edges. For every face-down coin in your pile, you will be rewarded with two gold coins. But be warned, if both piles do not contain the same number of face-down coins, the door will remain sealed for all eternity!""

The adventurer smiled, as this would be an easy task. All he had to do was flip over every coin so it was face down, and he would win the entire treasure! As he moved to the columns of coins, however, the light suddenly faded, and he was left in total darkness. The adventurer reached forward and picked up one of the coins, and was shocked when he realized that both sides felt almost the same. Without the light, he was unable to determine which side of the coin was heads and which side was tails. He carefully replaced the coin in its original orientation and tried to think of a way to solve the puzzle. Finally, out of desperation, the adventurer removed 30 coins to create his pile. He then carefully flipped over each coin in his pile, so its orientation was inverted from its original state.

""I've finished,"" he said, and the lights returned. Looking at the two piles, he noticed that the larger pile contained 14 face-down coins.

What was the outcome for the adventurer? If he failed the challenge, please respond with ""The adventurer died."" Otherwise, please provide the number of coins the adventurer won at the conclusion of the riddle. If the adventurer won any coins, provide your response as the number of coins, with no other text.",1,?,,,"{'Steps': '', 'Number of steps': '', 'How long did this take?': '', 'Tools': '', 'Number of tools': ''}"
